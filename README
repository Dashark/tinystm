OVERVIEW:

TinySTM is a lightweight but efficient word-based STM implementation
that uses encounter-time locking.  This distribution includes two
versions of TinySTM: write-back (updates are kept in thread-private
memory until commit time) and write-through (updates are directly
written to memory).  The version can be selected by editing the
Makefile.

TinySTM compiles and runs on 32 or 64-bit architectures.  It was tested
on various flavors of Unix, on Mac OS X, and on Windows using cygwin.
It comes with a few test applications, notably a linked list and a
red-black tree.

INSTALLATION:

TinySTM requires the atomic_ops library, freely available from:
    http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/

The environment variable LIBAO_HOME must be set to the installation
directory of atomic_ops, if different from /usr/local.

If you want to generate the libraries for TANGER, the environment
variable TANGER_HOME must be set to the installation directory of
TANGER. Alternatively, environment variables can be specified when
invoking `make'.

To compile TinySTM libraries, execute `make' in the main directory. To
compile test applications, execute `make test'. To compile libraries for
TANGER, execute `make tanger' or `make tanger TANGER_HOME=<path>'.
