The red-black tree implementation (rbtree.c, rbtree.h) comes from the
STAMP 0.9.4 distribution available from <http://stamp.stanford.edu>.
Files have not been modified in any way. Note that there may be warnings
when compiling rbtree.c on a 64-bit architecture and there are some
memory leaks (the red-black tree is not properely freed by the
rbtree_free() function).
